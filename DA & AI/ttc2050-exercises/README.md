### Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Overview
During my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I developed a strong foundation in Data Analytics (DA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on Python and its powerful libraries. This experience allowed me to explore data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

Key areas I covered include:

- Data Manipulation: Using Pandas and NumPy for cleaning, processing, and analyzing datasets.
- Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations with Matplotlib to identify trends and patterns.
  
- Machine Learning Models:
+ K-Means Clustering for grouping data points.
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification tasks.
+ Decision Trees for predictive modeling and decision-making.
  
Through hands-on projects and exercises, I learned to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance effectively. These skills have prepared me to tackle real-world challenges and apply AI-driven solutions to data-centric problems.
